Here’s a sample `README.md` file for your Playwright script:

# Amazon Web Scraping Script

This project is a Playwright-based web scraping tool that logs into Amazon, retrieves order history, and performs product searches based on user inputs. It demonstrates web automation and scraping techniques using Playwright and Typescript.

## Features

- Logs into Amazon with user-provided credentials.
- Scrapes and returns the last 10 items from the order history.
- Allows users to search for products on Amazon, returning the top 10 results for each search term.
- Results include product name, price, and link to the product.

## Technologies

- **Playwright**: Used for browser automation.
- **Typescript**: The scripting language used for this project.
- **Jest**: For unit testing (optional, if tests are implemented).

## Prerequisites

To run this project locally, you need to have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (version 14.x or later)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (for cloning the repository)

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the repository

Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command to clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/amazon-web-scraper.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd amazon-web-scraper
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies

Once inside the project directory, run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all the packages listed in the `package.json` file, including Playwright and Typescript.

### Step 3: Install Playwright Browsers

Playwright requires downloading browser binaries to run. You can install them with:

```bash
npx playwright install
```

### Step 4: Compile the Typescript code

If using TypeScript (as in this project), you will need to compile the code into JavaScript. You can do this by running:

```bash
npm run build
```

The compiled JavaScript files will be placed in the `dist` folder.

## Running the Script

To run the script and start the scraping process, execute the following command:

```bash
node dist/index.js
```

The script will ask for the following information:
- Your Amazon username (email or mobile number).
- Your Amazon password.

It will also ask for a comma-separated list of search terms for product searches on Amazon.

### Example

After entering your credentials and search strings, you might see results like this:

```bash
Please enter your Amazon Email or Mobile Number: your-email@example.com
Please enter your Amazon Password: *****
Search value: headphones
[
  {
    "name": "Sony WH-1000XM4 Wireless Headphones",
    "price": "₹24,999",
    "link": "https://www.amazon.in/dp/B08C7KG5LP"
  },
  ...
]
```

## Running Tests

If you have implemented unit tests using Jest, you can run the tests with:

```bash
npm run test
```

## Notes

- If your Amazon account has multi-factor authentication (MFA) enabled, you will need to complete the authentication process manually in the browser, and the script will wait for 25 seconds before continuing.
- Ensure that your credentials are valid and do not share them publicly.

## Future Improvements

- Improve error handling for login failures, MFA handling, and network issues.
- Implement better test coverage.
- Add support for more complex search filters.
